#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/adi-purdila)

Using product tours is a very good idea when you want to offer clear instructions for using that product. The same goes for websites or web apps. An interactive page tour can offer valuable insight into how to use the interface and can reduce the learning time by a lot. 

In this short course youâ€™ll learn how to create a very simple product tour using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from June, 2017**
